  **AI INSTRUCTION: PIXEL-TO-STITCH TRANSLATION**

  Carefully analyze the provided **[Input Image]**:

  1. **Knitted Pattern Conversion:**
     - Rasterize the [Input Image] into **pixel-art style knitting pattern**
     - Each pixel becomes an individual yarn stitch
     - Lines and shapes formed by visible stitch structure
     - Jacquard weave technique appearance
     - Low-resolution charm (like 8-bit to knit conversion)

  2. **Texture Transformation:**
     - Replace "ink/paint" medium with "wool yarn" medium
     - Visible individual stitch definition
     - V-shaped knit stitch texture throughout
     - Subtle dimensional depth from yarn thickness
     - Authentic handmade irregularity (slight imperfections add realism)

  3. **Color Simplification:**
     - Extract 3-8 dominant colors from input image
     - Convert to yarn-appropriate color palette
     - Maintain recognizability of original subject
