  Transform any illustration into a physical multi-layered acrylic art installation with ultra-clear, highly luminous materials. CRITICAL: The original art style, linework, and character features MUST BE STRICTLY PRESERVED without abstraction or simplification.

  **CUSTOMIZABLE PARAMETERS:**
  - **Base Panel Size:** [Select margin: "tight 2cm margin", "standard 4cm margin", "generous 6cm margin", "minimal 1cm margin"]
  - **Acrylic Transmission:** [Light quality: "ultra-clear glass-like", "high transmission luminous", "crystal clear brilliant", "diamond clarity"]
  - **Lighting Direction:** [Angle: "45-degree diagonal", "60-degree steep", "30-degree shallow", "cross-diagonal dual"]
  - **Wall Color:** [Background: "pure white matte", "off-white textured", "light grey concrete", "warm white plaster"]
  - **Standoff Style:** [Hardware: "polished chrome", "brushed nickel", "matte black", "brass gold", "transparent acrylic"]
  - **Caustic Intensity:** [Shadow projection: "vibrant high contrast", "moderate glow", "subtle soft", "dramatic saturated"]

  **AI INSTRUCTION: STYLE PRESERVATION RULE**

  Carefully analyze the provided **[Input Illustration]**:

  1. **ABSOLUTE PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:**
     - Original linework style MUST remain identical (thickness, texture, style)
     - Character features and proportions preserved exactly
     - Art style characteristics maintained (anime, realistic, cartoon, etc.)
     - No abstraction, simplification, or reinterpretation of the drawing
     - Facial expressions and details kept precisely as input
     - All fine details and intricate elements preserved

  2. **What Changes (Material Only):**
     - Medium transforms from digital/paper to transparent acrylic
     - Physical depth added through layer separation
     - Light transmission effects added
     - Caustic shadow projections created
     - **The artwork itself remains visually identical**

  **COMPOSITION RULE:**

  The final product photography creates a perfectly straight-on frontal view of a wall-mounted acrylic installation:

  1. **Aspect Ratio Matching:**
     - Output dimensions MUST match input illustration proportions
     - Portrait input → portrait output
     - Landscape input → landscape output
     - Square input → square output

  2. **Base Panel Specifications:**
     - Large clear acrylic base panel serves as foundation
     - Mounted to white wall using visible metallic standoffs
     - Panel edges are perfectly straight and beveled
     - Ultra-clear transparency with slight edge glow

  3. **Containment Rule (CRITICAL):**
     - The ENTIRE die-cut illustration must fit within base panel boundaries
     - No artwork elements extend beyond the base panel edges
     - Appropriate clear margin maintained between art and panel edge
     - Margin allows base panel visibility on all sides

  4. **Mounting Hardware:**
     - 4-6 visible metallic standoffs securing base to wall
     - Positioned at corners and strategic points
     - Creates 2-3cm air gap between panel and wall
     - Hardware casts subtle shadows on wall

  **MATERIAL PHYSICS RULE (HIGH TRANSMISSION):**

  The illustration is reconstructed as a physical multi-layered installation using ultra-clear, highly luminous tinted acrylic sheets optimized for maximal light transmission:

  1. **Material Construction Method:**
     - Each color area is a separate die-cut acrylic layer
     - Colors are the intrinsic color of the transparent material itself
     - NOT painted or printed - the material IS colored glass-like acrylic
     - Layers stacked with 3-5mm spacing creating dimensional depth

  2. **Color-Specific Material Properties:**

     **For Skin/White/Light Areas:**
     - MUST be **pure, colorless, ultra-clear glass-like acrylic**
     - Absolute transparency like crystal or water
     - Zero tint or coloration
     - Allows 95%+ light transmission
     - Subtle prismatic edge refraction

     **For Colored Areas (Hair/Clothes/Eyes/Accessories):**
     - **Highly translucent colored acrylic** with vibrant hue
     - Material itself IS the color (like colored glass)
     - Extremely see-through quality (70-85% light transmission)
     - Light passes through showing vivid color
     - No opacity or solid appearance
     - Jewel-like luminosity

     **For Dark/Black Areas:**
     - Deep tinted acrylic (dark grey, navy, or charcoal tint)
     - Still maintains translucency (40-60% transmission)
     - Not completely opaque - light filters through
     - Rich depth with dimensional glow

  3. **Edge Treatment:**
     - Precisely laser-cut or CNC-routed edges
     - Polished to diamond clarity
     - Slight light refraction at edge boundaries
     - Clean, professional finish quality

  4. **Layer Stacking Appearance:**
     - Multiple acrylic sheets layered with air gaps
     - Creates parallax depth effect
     - Each layer perfectly registered to others
     - Professional precision alignment

  **LIGHTING & SHADOW PHYSICS:**

  Strong directional lighting creates the signature characteristic of this medium - bright, glowing, colorful caustic projections:

  1. **Primary Lighting:**
     - Strong cool-toned directional light (5500K-6500K)
     - Positioned at 45-60 degree diagonal angle
     - Creates defined shadows and light paths
     - LED or halogen quality (not warm incandescent)

  2. **Light Transmission Behavior:**
     - Light passes THROUGH the highly transparent acrylic artwork
     - Colored areas filter the light into colored projections
     - Clear areas transmit pure white light
     - Creates vibrant chromatic caustics on wall

  3. **Caustic Shadow Characteristics (CRITICAL):**
     - **NOT dark or heavy shadows**
     - Bright, glowing, highly translucent colorful projections
     - Show original artwork colors as luminous shapes on wall
     - Wall texture visible underneath colored light
     - Shadow area feels light and airy, not opaque
     - Vibrant color transmission creates "stained glass window" effect

  4. **Wall Interaction:**
     - Projected caustics reveal wall's physical texture
     - Slight blur/softness due to distance from acrylic to wall
     - Color intensity varies with acrylic layer thickness
     - Multiple overlapping color projections create rich gradients

  5. **Ambient Environment:**
     - Subtle environmental fill light prevents complete darkness
     - White wall reflects soft bounced light
     - Overall bright, gallery-like presentation
     - Clean, modern aesthetic

  **DEPTH & DIMENSIONALITY:**

  - **Parallax Effect:** Multiple layers create subtle offset when viewed frontally
  - **Edge Glow:** Light catches acrylic edges creating luminous outlines
  - **Spatial Depth:** 1-2cm total depth from front layer to base panel
  - **Shadow Projection Distance:** Caustics cast 2-5cm behind installation
  - **Volumetric Quality:** Artwork has physical presence in space

  **PHOTOGRAPHY STYLE:**

  - **Camera Position:** Perfectly straight-on, perpendicular to wall surface
  - **Framing:** Entire artwork centered with even margins
  - **Focus:** Sharp detail on acrylic layers and caustic projections
  - **Depth of Field:** Medium (f/5.6-f/8) - keeps all layers and wall in focus
  - **Lens:** 50mm or 85mm equivalent (minimal distortion)
  - **Perspective:** Architectural straight lines, no keystoning

  **TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:**

  - **Resolution:** 8K ultra-high definition (7680×4320 or higher)
  - **Detail Level:** Ultra-detailed - visible acrylic texture, wall grain, light refraction
  - **Color Accuracy:** Precise representation of transmitted light colors
  - **Dynamic Range:** High - captures both bright refractive edges and subtle caustics

    - Slight Fresnel effect at viewing angles
    - Professional fabrication quality

  - **Wall Texture:**
    - Fine grain visible through projected caustics
