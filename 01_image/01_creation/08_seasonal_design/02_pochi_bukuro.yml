  **1. LAYOUT & COMPOSITION (FACE PROTECTION RULE):**

  **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:**

  - Facial expression must remain 100% visible and clear
  - This is the highest priority design rule

  **Dynamic Overlap Strategy:**
  - Mizuhiki cord **MAY overlap** the illustration body, background, or decorative elements
  - Creates cohesive, integrated design (e.g., crossing over body or surrounding space)

  **Smart Knot Positioning:**

  Adapt knot position based on character art composition:

  - **Option A (Above Head):** Place knot above character's head area
  - **Option B (Side Placement):** Position knot to left or right side of character
  - **Option C (Body Belt):** Place knot over character's chest or waist like a decorative belt, avoiding chin and face entirely
