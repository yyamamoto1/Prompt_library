**Description:**
Design a cozy bedroom in cute 3D style with isometric view.

**Prompt:**
```
Design a cozy bedroom in a cute 3D style with C4D-quality rendering, presented in an isometric view. The room includes a bed, bookshelf, sofa, green plants, a computer desk, and a computer setup. A framed painting hangs on the wall. Outside the window, a nighttime cityscape is visible with glowing buildings and a dark sky. All furniture and objects should have a soft, rounded, stylized design to match the cute 3D aesthetic. Lighting should be warm and inviting, creating a comfortable nighttime indoor atmosphere.
```
