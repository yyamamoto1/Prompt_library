Create a business card designed to look like a JSON file in VS Code.

**Prompt:**
```
A close-up shot of a hand holding a business card designed to look like a JSON file opened in VS Code. The card shows code formatted in realistic syntax-highlighted JSON code. The window includes typical toolbar icons and a title bar labeled Business Card.json, styled exactly like the interface of VS Code. Background is slightly blurred, keeping the focus on the card.
The card displays the following code formatted in JSON:
{
  "name": "Jamez Bondos",
  "title": "Your Title",
  "email": "your@email.com",
  "link": "yourwebsite"
}
```

**Note:** Replace the values of name, title, email, and link in the JSON code. The prompt is a simplified version.
