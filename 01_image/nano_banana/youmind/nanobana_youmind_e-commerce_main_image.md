## 3. 3D Hagoita (Battledore) Prompt for Nano Banana Pro

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-JA-blue) ![Raycast](https://img.shields.io/badge/🚀-Raycast_Friendly-purple)

### 📖 Description

A highly detailed prompt for Nano Banana Pro to generate a photorealistic image of a 3D Hagoita (traditional Japanese battledore) based on a reference character, specifying materials, composition, and text elements.

### 📝 Prompt

```
# Information Input: Please rewrite the contents within [ ].

[Character Features]: {argument name="Character Features" default="Anime-style girl. Brown medium hair, red eyes, slightly pointed teeth (gapped teeth)."}
[Attire]: {argument name="Attire" default="Luxurious Furisode Kimono"} (*Enter "Luxurious Furisode Kimono" for women, "Montsuki Hakama" for men, etc.)
[Signboard Text]: {argument name="Signboard Text" default="Tsuno-chan"}

High-quality photograph of a "Hagoita" (traditional Japanese New Year's decoration) displayed inside a glass case with a luxurious white wood frame.
The image is a vertical portrait size suitable for a smartphone screen.

Angle and Composition:
An angle capturing the Hagoita from "diagonally forward." By adding an angle instead of a frontal view, the thickness of the Hagoita and the three-dimensional relief of the Oshie (appliqué) are emphasized, creating a sense of depth.

Hagoita Design:
In the center of the Hagoita, a three-dimensional character created using the traditional Japanese craft technique "Oshie" is placed.
Character Features: [Character Features] The character is not full-body, but only the "upper body" is largely sculpted. Feet and hem are not drawn.
Character Attire: [Attire] made from vibrant, textured Japanese fabrics (Chirimen or Kinran).
The sleeves and decorations of the kimono are dynamic, extending widely to the left and right beyond the physical edges of the board, spreading into the air.
The fabric is layered multiple times, creating an overwhelming sense of volume and three-dimensionality.
Background Board Surface: The surface of the board behind the character is not just plain wood, but gorgeously decorated with "gold leaf" or "gold paintings of cherry blossoms and fans." Traditional Japanese patterns are drawn without gaps, making it extremely brilliant.
Handle (Grip): The handle part is not just a wooden stick, but decorated with "black lacquer" and gold patterns, or wrapped with beautiful "decorative cords" and "tassels."

Accessories:
A decorative "Temari" (handball) is placed at the base of the Hagoita.
A white wooden sign (standing signboard) is placed next to (in front of) the Hagoita. The sign also has thickness, and the wood texture is realistic.
[Important]: The text on the sign is written artistically in a "masterful, flowing brush script (Gyosho style)" as if written by a skilled craftsman, stating "[Signboard Text]." The style conveys the blurring and momentum of the ink brush.

Background and Atmosphere:
The background of the glass case features faint pink or gold Japanese patterns (cherry blossoms or flowing water patterns).
There is light reflection on the glass case, and high-quality lighting is illuminating it.
Photorealistic style, 8k resolution, extremely detailed.
```

## 15. E-commerce Product Listing: Embroidered Pinstripe Blazer

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-EN-blue)

### 📖 Description

A prompt specifically tailored for e-commerce product listings, focusing on generating a full-body image of a model wearing a highly detailed, embroidered dark pinstripe blazer. The prompt ensures exact replication of the embroidery patterns from a reference image and sets the scene in an elegant, softly lit modern living room, prioritizing texture and accurate color representation.

### 📝 Prompt

```
{
  "description": "Full-body image of an American woman wearing the exact same embroidered dark pinstripe blazer as in the reference image. The blazer must have the same embroidery patterns — including the red heart, colorful eye, pink text, yellow lightning bolt, and multi-colored patch details — all placed identically on the front panels and sleeves. The blazer should have a slightly oversized fit, sharp lapels, front pockets, and a single-button closure. The model wears a simple black top and short skirt underneath, maintaining the same styling. She has a confident, welcoming expression with a soft smile, exuding creativity and personality. She can stand casually with one hand holding a small handbag or resting by her side.",
  
  "style": "Chic indoor lifestyle aesthetic. The scene is set in a modern living room with soft, cozy decor — neutral tones, a stylish sofa, coffee table, indoor plant, and subtle art on the wall. The overall vibe is elegant yet contemporary, matching the artistic flair of the blazer.",
  
  "lighting": "Soft warm indoor lighting (between 3300K–3800K). Use diffused artificial light from lamps or ceiling fixtures to highlight the blazer texture and embroidery details. Avoid sunlight, window glare, or natural daylight. Lighting should evenly illuminate the model and outfit with soft shadows for realism.",
  
  "camera": "Full-body, vertical orientation at eye level. The model should be clearly visible from head to toe, standing naturally on the floor with balanced framing and slight space above the head. The photo should feel authentic, as if part of a lifestyle shoot inside a designer’s apartment.",
  
  "focus": "Crisp focus on the outfit’s embroidery, textures, and fabric weave. Maintain natural skin tones and accurate color representation of the blazer. The background can have a slight depth blur to keep the focus on the model and her outfit.",
  
  "environment": "Warm, cozy living room with beige or neutral tones, wooden flooring, soft furnishings, and minimalistic modern furniture. Decor accents like a lamp, indoor plant, or abstract painting can enhance the realism and elegance of the setting.",
  
  "negative_prompt": [
    "sunlight or daylight",
    "studio backdrop",
    "cropped frame",
    "different embroidery placement",
    "flat or smooth fabric",
    "cold lighting",
    "harsh shadows",
    "stylized or AI-art look"
  ]
}

## 16. Visual Creator Mode Prompt for Product Photography (Precision vs. Decay)

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-ZH-blue) ![Raycast](https://img.shields.io/badge/🚀-Raycast_Friendly-purple)

### 📖 Description

A complex system prompt for Nano Banana Pro's 'Visual Creator Mode,' instructing the AI to act as a top visual creative director. It takes a JSON 'Creative Skeleton' input (here, focusing on mechanical keyboard keycaps, dust, and gears, with a tension of 'Precision vs. Decay') and optimizes it into a final, high-impact English image generation prompt for industrial product photography.

### 📝 Prompt

```
## 🎨 Visual Creator Mode

You are a top visual creative director with AI image generation capabilities.

I will provide a 'Creative Skeleton' randomly generated by a program, in JSON format. Your task is:

1.  **Interpret and Optimize**: Understand the various dimensions in the JSON (theme, tension, light/shadow, scene, etc.) and integrate them into a coherent, visually impactful concept.
2.  **First, display the optimized prompt**: Output the final image generation prompt you will use (in English, approximately 50-100 words) in a code block (```prompt ... ```).
3.  **Then, directly generate the image**: Use the above prompt to generate a high-quality visual work.

---

### Follow these principles during optimization:

-   **Resolve Conflicts**: If the dimension combination has logical contradictions (e.g., 'Industrial Photography' with 'Miniature Fantasy'), choose a dominant style and harmonize.
-   **Visual Anchor**: Translate abstract tension (e.g., 'Whimsical vs. Real Material') into concrete visual elements (e.g., melted chocolate flowing over precise metal gears).
-   **Viral Hook**: The image must have an unexpected detail that 'makes people want to look twice.'
-   **Style Tone**: If a `creative_directive` exists, use it as the emotional guidance for the image; if an `oblique_strategy` exists, use it as a structural constraint.

## 19. E-commerce Product Listing: Grey Ruched Top and Black Mini Skirt

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-EN-blue)

### 📖 Description

A prompt for generating an e-commerce product image featuring a different American model wearing a specific outfit (grey ruched top, black mini skirt, and handbag) from a reference image. The goal is to maintain outfit consistency while changing the model's identity and setting the scene in a cozy, softly lit modern bedroom for a lifestyle fashion shot.

### 📝 Prompt

```
{
  "description": "A different female American model wearing the exact same outfit as in the reference: a fitted grey ruched top with long bell sleeves and a black mini skirt with a belt. She is holding a small light grey handbag. The model should have a warm, welcoming smile, slightly casual yet confident posture, and appear naturally expressive. Her hair can be blonde or light brown with soft waves or straight texture, differing clearly from the previous model. The scene should show her standing fully in a cozy, softly lit bedroom, maintaining elegance and realism.",
  
  "style": "Realistic indoor fashion photography with a calm, lifestyle tone. The focus should stay on the outfit and model expression, creating a relatable, sophisticated mood suitable for a bedroom setting.",

  "camera": "Full-body portrait shot at eye level, capturing the entire model from head to toe. Keep the bed, lamps, and subtle decor in frame for spatial context while emphasizing the model and outfit as the main subject.",
  
  "focus": "Preserve the outfit’s exact design, color, and fabric texture — same grey ruched top with flared cuffs, same black mini skirt and belt, and same handbag. Maintain natural body proportions and realistic lighting reflections.",
  
  "environment": "A modern bedroom with neutral color tones, a made bed with white and beige bedding, wooden flooring, bedside lamps, and soft ambient light. The scene must feel warm, authentic, and inviting, with no visible sunlight or outdoor light leaks.",
  
  "negative_prompt": [
    "same model as reference",
    "non-American features or ethnicity",
    "different outfit or accessories",
    "sunlight, daylight, or strong shadows",
