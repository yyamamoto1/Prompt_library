## 1. Miniature Bridge of Ancient Mathematical Knowledge

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-EN-blue)

### 📖 Description

A complex instruction prompt for generating a mythological epic image visualizing the transmission of an invention or technology (using 'math' as the input) across ancient civilizations. The output should be a miniature bridge structure connecting 3-5 civilization 'islands' on an aged parchment map, featuring distinct architectural styles, tiny figurines, and golden hour lighting.

### 📝 Prompt

```
<instruction>
Input A is an invention or technology  
Analyze: how this innovation appeared independently or was transmitted across ancient civilizations (Egyptian, Chinese, Islamic, Mayan, Greek, etc.).
Goal: Miniature bridge structure connecting 3-5 civilization "islands."
Rules:
* Base: ancient world map (aged parchment) as foundation
* Bridge structure: ornate multi-level walkway with different architectural styles for each section (columns, arches, pagoda elements)
* Each "island" platform: distinct civilization's version of Input A invention (Chinese compass vs Viking sunstone, Mayan zero vs Indian zero, etc.)
* Civilization figurines: tiny scholars/inventors from each culture examining each other's versions
* Include: trade route markers, tiny ships/caravans between islands, scrolls being passed
* Center of bridge: the "universal truth" they all discovered (mathematical formula, physical principle) etched in neutral symbol
* Materials: stone textures, gold leaf accents, cultural pattern details
* Lighting: mystical golden hour with light ray connecting all islands
Output: 1 x image, 16:9 landscape for maximum bridge span visibility, mythological epic photography
</instruction>
```

## 9. Macro Diorama Historical Rivalry (Science Wars)

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-EN-blue) ![Raycast](https://img.shields.io/badge/🚀-Raycast_Friendly-purple)

### 📖 Description

A complex, multi-phase prompt designed to generate a hyper-detailed macro diorama image illustrating a historical or modern rivalry (e.g., Elon Musk vs. a competitor). It requires integrating era-appropriate documents (the 'stage'), tiny figurines of the rivals in period clothing, giant tools, and critically, legible environmental text (identity anchors) to label the figures without floating text. This prompt is highly conceptual and structured.

### 📝 Prompt

```
<instructions> 
Input: Invention/Rivalry = {argument name="invention/rivalry" default="[User Choice]"}

Phase 1: Chronological Profiling
Ancient (Pre-500 AD): Stone/Papyrus, Oil Lamps. Labeling = Carved symbols or scroll signatures.
Renaissance (1400-1600): Parchment, Candlelight. Labeling = Wax seals, hand-lettered envelopes, book spines.
Industrial (1800-1940): Blueprints, Gaslight. Labeling = Typed Patent headers, Business Cards, Newspaper Headlines.
Modern (1950-Present): Circuit diagrams, Neon. Labeling = ID Badges, Magazine covers, Computer login screens.

Phase 2:
Goal: A hyper-detailed Macro Diorama where the environment identifies the rivals.

1. The Stage (The Document):
 The ground is the primary design medium of the era (Clay Tablet, Parchment, Blueprint, or CAD Printout).
The Invention:A 3D Prototype is rising from the center, separating the two figures.

2. The Living Miniatures: Two tiny, hyper-realistic figurines (The Rivals) interact with the invention.
  They are dressed strictly in period-accurate clothing.

3. The Identity Anchors (CRITICAL - Labeling):
Instruction: You must seamlessly integrate readable text into the "Giant" props near each figure to identify them to the viewer.
Prop A (Near Rival 1): Place a "Giant" personal item with their name visible. (e.g., A letter addressed to "Mr. T. Edison", a book titled "By C. Darwin", or a security badge reading "S. Jobs").
Prop B (Near Rival 2):Do the same for the second figure. (e.g., A Patent application signed "Nikola Tesla", or a court summons for "Mark Zuckerberg").
Context: These items must look like they were carelessly left on the desk, not floating labels.

4. The "Giant" Atmosphere:
The Tools: Giant-scale era-appropriate tools (Chisels, Quills, Soldering Irons) tower over the figures.
The Clutter: Period-specific debris (Marble dust, Ink spills, Burnt fuses, Empty soda cans).

5. Technical Specs:
Lighting: Era-appropriate source (Fire vs. Filament vs. LED).
Perspective:Tilt-shift macro photography (45-degree angle). focus on the miniatures.

Output: ONE image, 4:5 aspect ratio, photorealistic historical macro photography with legible environmental text. </instructions>
```

## 11. Detective Evidence Board Generation

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-EN-blue) ![Raycast](https://img.shields.io/badge/🚀-Raycast_Friendly-purple)

### 📖 Description

A prompt designed to generate a visual concept of a detective's evidence board, simulating an obsessive, late-night noir atmosphere. It details the cork board's contents: polaroids, maps, newspaper clippings, sticky notes, and red string connecting the evidence, emphasizing dramatic shadows from a single bare bulb and realistic clutter like coffee stains.

### 📝 Prompt

```
"A detective's evidence board investigating \\{argument name="subject/mystery" default="[SUBJECT/MYSTERY]"}\\\. Cork surface covered with pinned items: polaroid photographs with handwritten dates, a street map with circled locations, newspaper clippings with highlighted passages, sticky notes with theories and question marks, and printed documents with redacted black bars. Red string connects related evidence across the board, creating a web of connections. Thumbtacks in primary colors. A single bare bulb casts dramatic shadows. Coffee ring stains on some papers. The atmosphere is obsessive, late-night, noir—someone has been piecing this together for months. A few pins have fallen, suggesting frantic recent activity."
```

## 15. Historical Macro Diorama: Culinary Atlas Grid

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-EN-blue) ![Raycast](https://img.shields.io/badge/🚀-Raycast_Friendly-purple)

### 📖 Description

A complex, multi-phase prompt designed to generate a 2x2 grid of 'Historical Macro Dioramas' based on user-selected ingredients. It requires the AI to first determine an 'Era Texture' (Ancient, Renaissance, Industrial, Modern) and then create a hyper-detailed macro photograph of a messy workspace. Each panel features an open book with 2D sketches and a 3D pop-up diorama of a finished meal, complete with tiny period-accurate figurines of an inventor and a rival.

### 📝 Prompt

```
Role:Historical Art Director & Macro Photographer.
Input: Invention or Rivalry = [{argument name="user choice" default="User Choice"}]

Phase 1: Chronological Profiling
Before rendering, analyze the Year of the invention to determine the "Era Texture":
If Ancient (e.g., 200 BC): Surface = Rough Stone or Papyrus. Light = Oil Lamp/Torch. Clutter = Clay shards, bronze chisels, scrolls, figs/grapes.
If Renaissance (e.g., 1500): Surface = Dark Oak & Vellum. Light = Candle. Clutter = Quill feathers, wax seals, brass astrolabes, leather binding.
If Industrial (e.g., 1890): Surface = Green Felt or Mahogany. Light = Gas/Filament. Clutter = Newsprint, pocket watches, copper wire, soot.
If Modern (e.g., 1980): Surface = Formica or Metal. Light = Fluorescent/Neon. Clutter = Circuit boards, Polaroid photos, soda cans, plastic casings.

Phase 2: Visual Execution
Goal: A hyper-detailed "Macro Diorama" where the environment tells the story of the time period.
Subject: A messy, chaotic workspace viewed through a macro lens.

1. The Stage (The Document):
The "ground" is the primary design medium of that era 
The surface is filled with era-specific sketches/carvings of the invention.

2. The Living Miniatures:
Two tiny, hyper-realistic figurines (The Inventor & The Rival) stand on this surface.
They are dressed strictly in period-accurate clothing (Togas vs. Frock Coats vs. Turtlenecks).
Action: They are interacting with a 3D Prototype of the invention that is rising physically out of the document/tablet.

3. The "Giant" Atmosphere (Dynamic Enrichment):
The Wall: A massive background object establishing context (e.g., a carved stone stele, a tapestried wall, a vintage newspaper, or a stack of VHS tapes).
The Tools: Giant-scale tools used to make the invention loom over the figures like trees (e.g., a giant chisel, a massive quill dipped in ink, or a soldering iron).
The Debris: The mess of the creative process (e.g., stone dust, spilled ink, burnt fuses, or crumpled layout paper).
The Comforts: Food/Drink of the era (e.g., an earthen jug of wine, a porcelain tea cup, or a can of cola).

4. Technical Specs:
Lighting: Must match the "Era Light" determined in Phase 1 (Flickering warm fire vs. cold electric buzz).
Perspective: Tilt-shift macro photography (45-degree angle).
Texture: Extreme focus on material weathering (rust, dust, parchment cracks, or plastic sheen).

Output: ONE image, 4:5 aspect ratio, "Historical Macro Realism."
```

## 16. Culinary Atlas Grid: 3D Pop-up Recipe Dioramas

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-EN-blue) ![Raycast](https://img.shields.io/badge/🚀-Raycast_Friendly-purple)

### 📖 Description

A complex instructional prompt for generating a 2x2 grid image that functions as a 'Culinary Atlas'. Based on user-provided ingredients, the AI must select four countries and display an open book for each. The left page shows 2D vintage sketches, and the right page features a 3D pop-up diorama of the finished meal with a miniature chef, emphasizing macro detail and cinematic lighting.

### 📝 Prompt

```
<instruction>
Inputs: Ingredients = [{argument name="ingredient 1" default="Chicken"}, {argument name="ingredient 2" default="Bacon"}]

Step 1: Global Analysis
Analyze the ingredients.
Select 4 Distinct Countries with a famous dish using these ingredients  

Goal: A "Culinary Atlas" Grid showing 4 different cultural variations of the ingredients.

Layout Rule:
Output Format: A 2x2 Grid.
Content per Panel: Each of the 4 panels must show a Single Open Book Spread for that specific country.

Inside Each Panel (The Book Spread Rule):
Left Page (The History): 2D Vintage Sepia Sketches. A visual timeline or illustrated recipe of the dish (e.g., "1850 -> 1920 -> Today"). Flat, ink-drawn style.
Right Page (The Reality): 3D Pop-up Diorama. The finished, steaming meal emerges physically from the page. A tiny miniature chef from that country is standing on the page next to the massive food.
Consistency: All 4 books should look like part of the same series, but with different cultural contents.

Lighting: Cinematic top-down lighting, highlighting the depth difference between the flat left page and the 3D right page.
Output: 2x2 Grid, High Definition, Macro Detail.
</instruction>
```
