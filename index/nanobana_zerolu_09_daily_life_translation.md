## 9.1. Physical Store/Travel Translation

**Description:** Translates menus or signs while preserving the original surface texture (wall, paper, grease).

**Prompt:**
```text
Translate the Chinese dish names on the wall menu into English for foreign tourists. Texture Preservation : Crucial! Maintain the original aged, greasy, and textured look of the wall/paper. The new English text should look like it was written/printed on the same surface, with slight fading or wear to match. Currency : Keep the '¥' symbol and price numbers exactly as they are ; do not convert currency. Layout : align the English translations next to or replacing the Chinese characters naturally.
```

## 9.2. Digital Content Localization (Comics/Memes)

**Description:** Translates comics or memes by scrubbing text bubbles and replacing content with matching fonts.

**Prompt:**
```text
Translate the text in the speech bubbles/captions from [Japanese/English] to [Chinese]. Seamless Cleaning : Erase the original text and perfectly fill the background (e.g., the white speech bubble or the colored image background). Style Matching : Render the translated Chinese text using a casual, handwritten-style font (or bold impact font for memes) that matches the aesthetic of the original image. Fit : Ensure the text fits naturally within the bubbles without overcrowding.
