**Description:**
Create a hyper-realistic miniature computer setup inside a translucent keycap.

**Prompt:**
```
A hyper-realistic isometric 3D render of a miniature computer setup inside a translucent mechanical keyboard keycap, specifically placed on the ESC key of a real matte-finished mechanical keyboard. Inside the keycap, a tiny figure sits in a modern ergonomic chair, wearing a cozy textured hoodie, working at a glowing ultra-realistic computer screen. The environment is packed with lifelike miniature tech accessories: real-material desk lamps, monitors with reflections, tiny speaker grills, tangled cables, and ceramic mugs. The base of the scene is made of soil, rocks, and moss, with photorealistic textures and imperfections. The lighting inside the cap mimics natural morning sun, casting soft shadows and warm tones, while the outside has cold ambient reflections from the surrounding keyboard. The word "ESC" is subtly etched onto the top of the translucent keycap with a faint frosted glass effect — just barely visible depending on the angle. The surrounding keyboard keys like F1, Q, Shift, and CTRL are crisp, textured, and photorealistically lit. Shot as if taken with a high-end mobile phone camera, with shallow depth of field, perfect white balance, and cinematic detail.
