## <a id="case-68"></a>Case 68: Futuristic Logo Trading Card

**Creator:** [@hewarsaber](https://x.com/hewarsaber)

**Description:**
Create a futuristic trading card with neon aesthetic and company logo.

**Prompt:**
```
{
    "prompt": "A futuristic trading card with a dark, moody neon aesthetic and soft sci-fi lighting. The card features a semi-transparent, rounded rectangle with slightly muted glowing edges, appearing as if made of holographic glass. At the center is a large glowing logo of {{logo}}, with no additional text or label, illuminated with a smooth gradient of {{colors}}, but not overly bright. The reflections on the card surface should be subtle, with a slight glossy finish catching ambient light. The background is a dark carbon fiber texture or deep gradient with soft ambient glows bleeding into the edges. Add subtle light rays streaming down diagonally from the top, giving the scene a soft cinematic glow. Apply light motion blur to the edges and reflections to give the scene a sense of depth and energy, as if it's part of a high-end tech animation still. Below the card, include realistic floor reflections that mirror the neon edges and logo—slightly diffused for a grounded, futuristic look. Text elements are minimal and softly lit: top-left shows '{{ticker}}', top-right has a stylized signature, and the bottom displays '{{company_name}}' with a serial number '{{card_number}}', a revenue badge reading '{{revenue}}', and the year '{{year}}'. Typography should have a faint glow with slight blurring, and all elements should feel premium, elegant, and softly illuminated—like a high-end cyberpunk collectible card.",
    "style": {
        "lighting": "Neon glow, soft reflections",
        "font": "Modern sans-serif, clean and minimal",
        "layout": "Centered, structured like a digital collectible card",
        "materials": "Glass, holographic plastic, glowing metal edges"
    },
    "parameters": {
        "logo": "Tesla logo",
        "ticker": "TSLA",
        "company_name": "Tesla Inc.",
        "card_number": "#0006",
        "revenue": "$96.8B",
        "year": "2025",
        "colors": [
            "red",
            "white",
            "dark gray"
        ]
    },
    "medium": "3D render, high-resolution digital art",
    "size": "1080px by 1080px"
}
```

**Note:** The prompt uses a JSON structure. Modify values in the `parameters` object (logo, ticker, company_name, colors, etc.) to customize. For custom logos, specify in `parameters.logo` and upload the image.

**Reference Image Required:** (Optional) Upload a custom logo image.

## <a id="case-67"></a>Case 67: Ultra-realistic 3D Game

**Creator:** [@ZHO_ZHO_ZHO](https://x.com/ZHO_ZHO_ZHO)
**Source:** https://x.com/ZHO_ZHO_ZHO/status/1913648013144137840

**Description:**
Create an ultra-realistic 3D rendered game scene with nostalgic 2008 atmosphere.

**Prompt:**
```
Ultra-realistic 3D rendered image that replicates the character design of Natasha from Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 in 2008, following the original model exactly. The scene is set in a dim and cluttered bedroom from the year 2008. The character is sitting on the carpet, facing an old-fashioned television that is playing Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 and a game console controller.
The entire room is filled with a nostalgic atmosphere of the year 2008: snack packaging bags, soda cans, posters, and tangled wires are everywhere. Natasha Volkova is captured in the moment of turning her head, looking back at the camera over her shoulder. There is an innocent smile on her iconic ethereally beautiful face. Her upper body is slightly twisted, with a natural dynamic, as if she is reacting to being startled by the flash.
The flash slightly overexposes her face and clothes, making her silhouette stand out more prominently in the dimly lit room. The whole photo appears raw and natural. The strong contrast between light and dark casts deep shadows behind her. The image is full of tactile feel, with a simulated texture that resembles an authentic film snapshot from 2008.

## <a id="case-19"></a>Case 19: Country Diorama in a Toy Box

**Creator:** [@TheRelianceAI](https://x.com/TheRelianceAI)
**Source:** https://x.com/TheRelianceAI/status/1925223613055017251

**Description:**
Create a 3D-printed diorama of a country inside a cardboard box.

**Prompt:**
```
An ultra-realistic top-down photograph of a 3D-printed diorama inside a beige cardboard box, with the lid being held open by two human hands. The interior of the box reveals a miniature landscape of [COUNTRY NAME], featuring iconic landmarks, terrain, buildings, rivers, vegetation, and crowds of tiny, detailed human figures. The diorama is filled with vibrant, geographically appropriate elements, all crafted in a tactile, toy-like style using matte 3D-printed textures with visible layer lines. At the top, the inside of the box lid displays the phrase "[COUNTRY NAME]" in large, colorful, raised plastic letters—each letter in a different bright color. The lighting is warm and cinematic, highlighting the textures and shadows to evoke a sense of realism and charm, as if the viewer is opening a magical miniature version of the nation
```

**Note:** Replace `[COUNTRY NAME]` with a specific country name.
