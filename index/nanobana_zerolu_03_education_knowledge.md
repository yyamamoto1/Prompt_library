## 3.2. Kids' Crayon Travel Journal Illustrator

**Description:** Generate a childlike travel journal illustration for a city.

**Prompt:**
```text
--- Prompt ---

Please create a vibrant, child-like crayon-style vertical (9:16) illustration titled "{City Name} Travel Journal."
The artwork should look as if it were drawn by a curious child using colorful crayons, featuring a soft, warm light-toned background (such as pale yellow), combined with bright reds, blues, greens, and other cheerful colors to create a cozy, playful travel atmosphere.

I. Main Scene: Travel-Journal Style Route Map

In the center of the illustration, draw a "winding, zigzagging travel route" with arrows and dotted lines connecting multiple locations.
The route should automatically generate recommended attractions based on {Number of Days}:

Example structure (auto-filled with {City Name}-related content):

- "Stop 1: {Attraction 1 + short fun description}"
- "Stop 2: {Attraction 2 + short fun description}"
- "Stop 3: {Attraction 3 + short fun description}"
- …
- "Final Stop: {Local signature food or souvenir + warm closing remark}"

Rules:
- If no number of days is provided, default to a 1-day highlight itinerary.

II. Surrounding Playful Elements (Auto-adapt to the City)

Add many cute doodles and child-like decorative elements around the route, such as:

1. Adorable travel characters
   - A child holding a local snack
   - A little adventurer with a backpack

2. Q-style hand-drawn iconic landmarks
   - "{City Landmark 1}"
   - "{City Landmark 2}"
   - "{City Landmark 3}"

3. Funny signboards
   - "Don't get lost!"
   - "Crowds ahead!"
   - "Yummy food this way!"
   (Auto-adjust contextually for the city)

4. Sticker-style short phrases
   - "{City Name} travel memories unlocked!"
   - "{City Name} food adventure!"
   - "Where to next?"

5. Cute icons of local foods
   - "{Local Food 1}"
   - "{Local Food 2}"
   - "{Local Food 3}"

6. Childlike exclamations
   - "I didn't know {City Name} was so fun!"
   - "I want to come again!"

III. Overall Art Style Requirements

- Crayon / children's hand-drawn travel diary style
- Bright, warm, colorful palette
- Cozy but full and lively composition
- Emphasize the joy of exploring
- All text should be in a cute handwritten font
- Make the entire page feel like a young child's fun travel-journal entry
```

## 3.3. Financial Sankey Diagram Visualization

**Description:** Create a professional financial Sankey diagram.

**Prompt:**
```text
[Subject]: A professional financial Sankey diagram visualizing the Income Statement of a major corporation, in the style of "App Economy Insights" and US corporate financial reports.[Visual Style]: High-fidelity vector infographic, clean minimalist aesthetic, flat design. The background is a clean, very light grey or off-white.[Color Strategy - CRITICAL]:
Analyze the [Insert Brand Name Here] logo. Extract its primary brand color (e.g., if Nvidia use neon green, if Meta use blue, if Tesla use red).
Use this primary color as the dominant theme for the main revenue flows and profit blocks.
Create a harmonious color palette based on this primary color: use saturated shades for the vertical nodes (bars) and semi-transparent, lighter opacity gradients for the flowing paths to ensure a cohesive and professional look. Avoid clashing colors.[Composition & Structure]:
Flow: A horizontal flow from Left (Revenue Sources) to Right (Net Profit).
Texture: The connecting paths (flows) must appear "silky smooth" with elegant Bezier curves, looking like liquid ribbons, not jagged lines.
Iconography: On the left side (Revenue sources), include specific, minimalist flat vector icons representing the business segments (e.g., a car icon for automotive, a cloud icon for services, a chip icon for hardware).
Branding: Place the official [Insert Brand Name Here] logo clearly at the top center or near the central revenue bar.[Details]: High resolution, 4k, sharp typography (sans-serif), professional data visualization layout. The chart clearly distinguishes between Revenue, Gross Profit, Operating Expenses, and Net Profit.
