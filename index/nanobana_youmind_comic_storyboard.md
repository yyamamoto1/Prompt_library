## 4. Nano Banana Pro Manga Generation Prompt with Character Consistency Rules

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-JA-blue) ![Raycast](https://img.shields.io/badge/🚀-Raycast_Friendly-purple)

### 📖 Description

A detailed system prompt for Nano Banana Pro aimed at generating manga pages while strictly maintaining character consistency based on an uploaded reference image. It includes specific rules for fixing character features (hair, eyes, clothing) as 'master data,' applying a chibi style only to body proportions, and enforcing strict rules for natural Japanese dialogue and camera work to avoid monotony.

### 📝 Prompt

```
Please generate a manga page.

#Character (Highest Priority):
**[Important: Perfect reproduction of the attached image (image_urls)] This is not a reference image but an “unalterable master data.” Strictly adhere to the following processes in all generated panels.**

1. **Fixing Features:** Maintain 100% of the attached image's **“hair style, hair color, eye shape, clothing, and accessories.”** Unauthorized arrangements or simplifications are prohibited.
2. **Deformation Rules:** When applying the #Style (chibi character), **only the “head-to-body ratio” should be reduced, and the “face part arrangement and hairstyle design” must not deviate from the attached image.**
3. **Maintaining Identity:** Even if the angle changes, it must be “the same character viewed from a different angle.” Do not change the face to look like a different person.
4. **Do not cause “Prompt Bleed (instruction leakage).”**

#Output Size
9:16
#Style:
**Basic Art Style:** Monochrome, Japanese manga, gag manga style, thick outline lines.
**Style prompt:** Japanese manga, chibi style, thick outline lines, monochrome.
**Format:** Vertical writing, Japanese panel layout read from right to left.

#Text Generation Rules (Strict Adherence):
**[Important: Natural Japanese and Elimination of Duplication]**
When generating dialogue in the manga, perform proofreading immediately before output to absolutely prevent the following errors:

1. **Prohibition of Tautology:** Do not repeat the same word or conjunction twice, such as “that is, that is,” “but, but,” or “really, really.” Stuttering expressions are prohibited.
2. **Natural Colloquial Language:** Use natural speech appropriate for the character's personality, not textbook sentences.
3. **Garbled Text Check:** Confirm that Kanji and Hiragana are not corrupted.

#Direction/Camera Work:
**[Important: Direction while maintaining features]**
Use the following camera work within the range that does not distort the character's face or hairstyle to avoid monotony:

- **Close-up:** Emphasizing emotion (※Do not overly deform facial parts)
- **Long Shot:** Explaining the situation
- **High/Low Angle:** Expressing impact or cuteness
- **Diagonal Composition:** Expressing agitation or action

#Scenario Progression:
If no specific panel designation is given, summarize and compose in 3 to 5 panels.
Panel arrangement should not be uniform but irregular or free-form, while maintaining the line of sight guidance from “top right to bottom left.”

#Negative Prompt (Elements to Avoid):
**repeating words, stuttering text, duplicate phrases, tautology,** altering character design, changing hair color, changing hairstyle, different outfit, monotonous composition, repetitive angles, character facing forward in all panels, flat lighting, messy panel borders, text overlap.

#Scenario: {argument name="scenario" default="Think of the continuation of the attached manga."}
```

## 11. Stranger Things Cinematic Scene: Steve vs. Vecna

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-EN-blue)

### 📖 Description

A highly specific, cinematic prompt inspired by the TV show Stranger Things. It details a dramatic scene in the Upside Down featuring Steve Harrington suspended in mid-air with an emotional expression, and Vecna silently controlling the moment. It requires two reference images for the characters and focuses on emotional lighting, hyper-real detail, and a dark horror drama style.

### 📝 Prompt

```
Ultra-realistic cinematic scene inspired by Stranger Things. Steve Harrington (from Image 1) is suspended in mid-air inside the Upside Down, his face clearly visible and emotionally broken—eyes glassy with tears, lips trembling, fear mixed with acceptance. His body is slightly contorted by an unseen psychic force, veins subtly visible, a faint trail of blood from his nose.
Vecna (from Image 2) appears behind him, partially emerging from darkness and red mist, not attacking violently but silently controlling the moment, one hand raised with cracked, organic skin and glowing red energy. Vecna’s presence feels inevitable and overwhelming rather than loud.
The environment is alive: black vines crawl along ruined structures, spores floating slowly through the air like falling ash. Steve’s bat lies broken on the ground below, symbolizing loss and sacrifice.
Lighting is highly emotional—cold blue light on Steve’s face to highlight vulnerability, contrasted with deep crimson and shadow around Vecna. Shallow depth of field, cinematic focus on Steve’s expression, volumetric fog, dramatic backlighting, hyper-real skin detail, emotional micro-expressions, Netflix dark horror drama style, photorealistic, ultra-detailed, 35mm film look
```

## 13. Psychic Woman in Underground Lab Cinematic Scene

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-EN-blue) ![Raycast](https://img.shields.io/badge/🚀-Raycast_Friendly-purple)

### 📖 Description

A highly cinematic and detailed prompt for generating a photorealistic scene inspired by Hawkins Lab (Stranger Things). It features a young psychic woman generating a dense, crackling sphere of red-orange energy, causing lab equipment to levitate and glass to fracture, emphasizing dramatic lighting, high contrast, and psychological tension.

### 📝 Prompt

```
A cinematic photorealistic portrait of a young psychic woman inside an underground government research facility inspired by {argument name="inspiration" default="Hawkins Lab"}. Sterile concrete walls, glass observation panels, tangled cables, and industrial equipment surround her. Fluorescent ceiling lights flicker, casting cold white and red emergency lighting across the room.

The woman stands centered, calm yet intensely focused. Her dark wavy hair lifts subtly as if affected by invisible force. Her warm brown eyes are locked forward with controlled concentration. A faint nosebleed traces down her upper lip, suggesting mental strain.

She wears a simple institutional gown with muted red tones, minimal and utilitarian. One hand is extended toward the viewer, palm open, generating a dense sphere of psychic energy—glowing red-orange, crackling with electrical filaments, heat distortion, and suspended particles, bending the air around it.

Lab equipment levitates, glass fractures midair, sparks erupt from torn cables, and debris hangs frozen in suspension. A dim red-orange dimensional glow seeps through cracks in the walls, hinting at another realm pressing through reality.

Cinematic lighting, strong rim light, dramatic shadows, sharp focus on face and hand, shallow depth of field, ultra-detailed textures, photorealistic supernatural realism, high contrast, volumetric lighting, tense psychological atmosphere.

## 14. Character Inner Monologue Comic Prompt (Japanese)

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-JA-blue) ![Raycast](https://img.shields.io/badge/🚀-Raycast_Friendly-purple)

### 📖 Description

A complex, multi-step prompt template designed for Nano Banana Pro to generate a Japanese comic panel visualizing a character's 'inner monologue' or 'brainstorming session.' It requires user input for character settings and a dilemma, then automatically assigns roles (Optimistic, Pessimistic, Logical, My-Pace) to four mini-characters (chibi-style) who appear above the main character's head, each with a specific pose and dialogue bubble.

### 📝 Prompt

```
# User Input (Rewrite and submit this)
【Character Settings】
{argument name="character settings" default="Brown hair, twin tails, red eyes, fangs, black cloak, white shirt"}

【Main Character's Worry】
*   Content: {argument name="worry" default="I want to eat lots of donuts"}

# Command
You are an image generation engine. Follow the steps below to generate one image based on the user's input.
**Do not output intermediate thoughts or script text. Generate the image immediately.**
# Process (Internal Processing)
1. **Automatic Dialogue Determination**:
*   **Main Character**: Monologues the 【Worry】 input by the user.
*   **Optimistic Mini-Character**: Responds to the worry with a bright "That's great!" and offers support/encouragement.
*   **Pessimistic Mini-Character**: Anticipates the worst-case scenario for the worry, saying "No good..." and despairs.
*   **My-Pace Mini-Character**: **【IMPORTANT】Talks about something completely unrelated to the worry (e.g., tonight's dinner, sleepiness, hobbies).**
*   **Logical Mini-Character**: **【IMPORTANT】Performs a coin toss and randomly decides to speak either "For" (presenting a rational solution) or "Against" (pointing out risks).**

2. **Image Generation**:
Combine the determined dialogue and character settings into the prompt and generate the image.
### Image Generation Prompt Requirements
*   **Aspect Ratio**: 2:3
*   **Style**: Japanese comic/anime style, high quality.

Four "mini-characters (chibi-style)" of the same character are aligned along the main character's head line.
【IMPORTANT】The four mini-characters are lined up "in a horizontal row."
【IMPORTANT】The feet of the mini-characters are hidden (overlapping) by the main character's head or hair.
*   **【IMPORTANT: Prohibitions】**:
*   **Absolutely do not write names or roles (e.g., "Logical," "Optimistic") below or around the characters.**
*   **The only place text is allowed is inside the "speech bubbles."**
*   Bottom 1/3 of the screen: Extreme close-up of the main character's face. Serious expression. Thinking, hand on chin or mouth, gaze downward. A large horizontal thought bubble.
*   Top 2/3 of the screen: Four mini-characters are lined up "in a horizontal row" right behind the main character's head.
*   **Important**: The mini-characters are close enough that their feet are hidden by the main character's head or hair.
*   **Mini-Character Arrangement and Pose**:
From left to right:
1. Logical: Serious face, adjusting glasses, or pointing with a finger.
