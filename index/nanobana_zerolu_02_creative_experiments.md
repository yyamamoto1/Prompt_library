## 2.9. Split View 3D Render - iPhone 17 Pro

**Description:** Create a 3D render with realistic left half and wireframe right half.

**Prompt:**
```text
Create a high-quality, realistic 3D render of exactly one instance of the object: [Orange iPhone 17 Pro].
The object must float freely in mid-air and be gently tilted and rotated in 3D space (not front-facing).
Use a soft, minimalist dark background in a clean 1080×1080 composition.
Left Half — Full Realism
The left half of the object should appear exactly as it looks in real life
— accurate materials, colors, textures, reflections, and proportions.
This half must be completely opaque with no transparency and no wireframe overlay.
No soft transition, no fading, no blending.
Right Half — Hard Cut Wireframe Interior
The right half must switch cleanly to a wireframe interior diagram.
The boundary between the two halves must be a perfectly vertical, perfectly sharp, crisp cut line, stretching straight from the top edge to the bottom edge of the object.
No diagonal edges, no curved slicing, no gradient.
The wireframe must use only two line colors:
Primary: white (≈80% of all lines)
Secondary: a color sampled from the dominant color of the realistic half (<20% of lines)
The wireframe lines must be thin, precise, aligned, and engineering-style.
Every wireframe component must perfectly match the geometry of the object.
Strict Single-Object Rule
Render only ONE object in the entire frame.  Render only one physical object.
Do NOT show a second object from any angle. Do NOT show a second object as a reflection, shadow, silhouette, outline, ghost image, or transparency. Do NOT show a second object for comparison or display purposes. Do NOT show both the front and the back separately.
Do NOT show an extra device behind, beside, underneath, or partially hidden.
Only one single object is allowed in the entire frame.
No duplicate objects, no mirrored back-and-front pairings, no reflections showing a second object.
The object must appear alone, floating.
Pose & Lighting:
Apply a natural, subtle tilt + rotation in 3D to make it look like a floating product visualization.
Use soft, neutral global illumination and no shadows under the object.
No extra props, no text, no labels unless explicitly requested.
```

## 2.10. USA 3D Diorama with Landmarks

**Description:** Create an isometric 3D diorama of US landmarks.

**Prompt:**
```text
Create a high-detail 3D isometric diorama of the entire United States, where each state is represented as its own miniature platform. Inside each state, place a stylized, small-scale 3D model of that state's most iconic landmark. Use the same visual style as a cute, polished 3D city diorama: soft pastel colors, clean materials, smooth rounded forms, gentle shadows, and subtle reflections. Each landmark should look like a miniature model, charming, simplified, but clearly recognizable. Arrange the states in accurate geographical layout, with consistent lighting and perspective. Include state labels and landmark labels in a clean, modern font, floating above or near each model.

## 2.12. City's Tallest Buildings 3D Cartoon View

**Description:** Create a miniature 3D view of city's tallest buildings.

**Prompt:**
```text
Present a clear, side miniature 3D cartoon view of [YOUR CITY] tallest buildings. Use minimal textures with realistic materials and soft, lifelike lighting and shadows. Use a clean, minimalistic composition showing exactly the three tallest buildings in Sopot, arranged from LEFT to RIGHT in STRICT descending height order. The tallest must appear visibly tallest, the second must be clearly shorter than the first, and the third must be clearly shorter than the second.
All buildings must follow accurate relative proportions: if a building is taller in real life, it MUST be taller in the image by the same approximate ratio. No building may be visually stretched or compressed.
Each building should stand separately on a thin, simple ceramic base. Below each base, centered text should display:
Height in meters — semibold sans-serif, medium size
Year built — lighter-weight sans-serif, smaller size, directly beneath the height text
Provide consistent padding, spacing, leading, and kerning. Write "YOUR CITY NAME" centered above the buildings, using a medium-sized sans-serif font.
 No building top should overlap or touch the text above.Use accurate architectural proportions based on real-world references.Maintain consistent camera angle and identical scale for each building model.
No forced perspective. Use straight-on orthographic-style rendering. Do not exaggerate or stylize size differences beyond proportional accuracy.

Use a square 1080×1080 composition.Use a clean, neutral background. Ensure no extra objects are present.

## 2.16. Cinematic Keyframe Generator

**Description:** Generates cinematic keyframes and storyboards from a reference image.

**Prompt:**
```text
<role>
You are an award-winning trailer director + cinematographer + storyboard artist. Your job: turn ONE reference image into a cohesive cinematic short sequence, then output AI-video-ready keyframes.
</role>

<input>
User provides: one reference image (image).
</input>

<non-negotiable rules - continuity & truthfulness>
1) First, analyze the full composition: identify ALL key subjects (person/group/vehicle/object/animal/props/environment elements) and describe spatial relationships and interactions (left/right/foreground/background, facing direction, what each is doing).
2) Do NOT guess real identities, exact real-world locations, or brand ownership. Stick to visible facts. Mood/atmosphere inference is allowed, but never present it as real-world truth.
3) Strict continuity across ALL shots: same subjects, same wardrobe/appearance, same environment, same time-of-day and lighting style. Only action, expression, blocking, framing, angle, and camera movement may change.
4) Depth of field must be realistic: deeper in wides, shallower in close-ups with natural bokeh. Keep ONE consistent cinematic color grade across the entire sequence.
5) Do NOT introduce new characters/objects not present in the reference image. If you need tension/conflict, imply it off-screen (shadow, sound, reflection, occlusion, gaze).
</non-negotiable rules - continuity & truthfulness>

<goal>
Expand the image into a 10–20 second cinematic clip with a clear theme and emotional progression (setup → build → turn → payoff).
The user will generate video clips from your keyframes and stitch them into a final sequence.
</goal>

<step 1 - scene breakdown>
Output (with clear subheadings):
- Subjects: list each key subject (A/B/C…), describe visible traits (wardrobe/material/form), relative positions, facing direction, action/state, and any interaction.
- Environment & Lighting: interior/exterior, spatial layout, background elements, ground/walls/materials, light direction & quality (hard/soft; key/fill/rim), implied time-of-day, 3–8 vibe keywords.
- Visual Anchors: list 3–6 visual traits that must stay constant across all shots (palette, signature prop, key light source, weather/fog/rain, grain/texture, background markers).
</step 1 - scene breakdown>

<step 2 - theme & story>
From the image, propose:
- Theme: one sentence.
- Logline: one restrained trailer-style sentence grounded in what the image can support.
- Emotional Arc: 4 beats (setup/build/turn/payoff), one line each.
</step 2 - theme & story>

<step 3 - cinematic approach>
Choose and explain your filmmaking approach (must include):
- Shot progression strategy: how you move from wide to close (or reverse) to serve the beats
- Camera movement plan: push/pull/pan/dolly/track/orbit/handheld micro-shake/gimbal—and WHY
- Lens & exposure suggestions: focal length range (18/24/35/50/85mm etc.), DoF tendency (shallow/medium/deep), shutter "feel" (cinematic vs documentary)
- Light & color: contrast, key tones, material rendering priorities, optional grain (must match the reference style)
</step 3 - cinematic approach>

<step 4 - keyframes for AI video (primary deliverable)>
Output a Keyframe List: default 9–12 frames (later assembled into ONE master grid). These frames must stitch into a coherent 10–20s sequence with a clear 4-beat arc.
Each frame must be a plausible continuation within the SAME environment.
</step 4 - keyframes for AI video>

<step 5 - contact sheet output (MUST OUTPUT ONE BIG GRID IMAGE)>
You MUST additionally output ONE single master image: a Cinematic Contact Sheet / Storyboard Grid containing ALL keyframes in one large image.
- Default grid: 3x3. If more than 9 keyframes, use 4x3 or 5x3 so every keyframe fits into ONE image.
Requirements:
1) The single master image must include every keyframe as a separate panel (one shot per cell) for easy selection.
2) Each panel must be clearly labeled: KF number + shot type + suggested duration (labels placed in safe margins, never covering the subject).
3) Strict continuity across ALL panels: same subjects, same wardrobe/appearance, same environment, same lighting & same cinematic color grade; only action/expression/blocking/framing/movement changes.
4) DoF shifts realistically: shallow in close-ups, deeper in wides; photoreal textures and consistent grading.
5) After the master grid image, output the full text breakdown for each KF in order so the user can regenerate any single frame at higher quality.
</step 5 - contact sheet output>

<final output format>
Output in this order:
A) Scene Breakdown
B) Theme & Story
C) Cinematic Approach
D) Keyframes (KF# list)
E) ONE Master Contact Sheet Image (All KFs in one grid)
</final output format>
```

## 2.19. Novel Scene 3D Poster

**Description:** A 3D poster design for novels or films with a miniature diorama effect.

**Prompt:**
```text
Design a high-quality 3D poster for the movie/novel "Name to be added", first retrieving information about the movie/novel and famous scenes.

First, please use your knowledge base to retrieve information about this movie/novel and find a representative famous scene or core location. In the center of the image, construct this scene as a delicate axonometric 3D miniature model. The style should adopt DreamWorks Animation's delicate and soft rendering style. You need to reproduce the architectural details, character dynamics, and environmental atmosphere of that time, whether it's a storm or a quiet afternoon, naturally integrating into the model's lighting.

Regarding the background, do not use a simple pure white background. Please create a void environment with faint ink wash diffusion and flowing light mist around the model, with elegant colors, making the image look breathable and have depth, highlighting the preciousness of the central model.

Finally, for the bottom layout, please generate Chinese text. Center the novel title with a font that matches the original style. Below the title, automatically retrieve and typeset a classic description or quote about this scene from the original work, using an elegant serif font. The overall layout should be as精致balanced as a high-end museum exhibit label.

## 2.20. Miniature Swimming Pool Diorama

**Description:** Surreal miniature-world collage poster featuring an oversized container as a swimming pool.

**Prompt:**
```text
Surreal miniature-world collage poster featuring an oversized open blue Nivea-style tin repurposed as a whimsical swimming pool filled with glossy white "cream-water."
Tiny sunbathers float in pastel swim rings, lounge on miniature deck chairs, and slide into the cream pool from a small blue slide.
The background is a soft, warm, lightly textured countertop surface subtle marble or matte stone, evenly lit, no heavy veins or visual noise.
Keep the scene grounded with soft shadows beneath props and figures.
Surrounding the tin, keep the playful diorama elements: a small wooden deck with micro figures, pastel umbrellas, lounge chairs, and compact handcrafted accessories. Maintain the hovering pastel inflatables and plush cloud-like shapes, but ensure they feel like stylised decorative objects staged above the countertop
Preserve the soft, high-saturation, toy-like aesthetic with plush textures, pastel gradients, and gentle lighting.

```text
Generate a hyperrealistic realistic-anime portrait of a female character standing in a completely black background.
Lighting: use a **narrow beam spotlight** focused only on the center of the face.

Not soft lighting.
Hair: long dark hair with some strands falling over the face. The lower parts of the hair should fade into the shadows.
Pose: one hand raised gently to the lips in a shy, hesitant gesture.
Eyes looking directly at the camera with a mysterious mood.
Clothing: black long-sleeve knit sweater;
the sweater and body should mostly disappear into the darkness with minimal detail.
Overall tone: dark, moody, dramatic, mysterious.
High-contrast only in the lit portion of the face.
Everything outside the spotlight should be nearly invisible.
